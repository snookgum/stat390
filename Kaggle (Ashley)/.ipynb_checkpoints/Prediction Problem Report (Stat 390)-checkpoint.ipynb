    "**My initial approach to feature selection was to remove predictors that were very highly correlated with each other before running feature selection using MARS. If two predictors had a correlation above 0.9, I would drop one of the predictors. I would also drop predictors that had a very low correlation with the target variable `y`. However, by using this approach, I was not able to get my RMSE below 9.0 despite ensembling several models such as CatBoost and XGBoost. It is possible that this method was ineffective because removing these predictors might have resulted in underfitting and prevented my models from being able to capture the subtle but important effects of these predictors on the target variable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In terms of the models I attempted, I initially found that using XGBoost improved my RMSE score significantly compared to other models such as MARS and Random Forest. However, my RMSE was still above the target of 8.75. I found that by ensembling XGBoost and CatBoost and selecting predictors based on MARS feature selection, I was able to get my RMSE to around 8.77. Nevertheless, I realized that my model might still be underfitting, since MARS feature selection cut down the number of predictors that had non-zero importance to around 20-30 predictors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**I decided to perform feature selection using CatBoost in addition to the feature selection with MARS. I tuned and trained a CatBoost model using all the predictors, and chose the predictors that had a non-zero importance. I then ran another CatBoost model using the new set of predictors. I also ran a MARS model on the set of predictors I found with MARS feature selection. I tried to stack the CatBoost and MARS models together using various metamodels, but found that ElasticNetCV worked best. This model allowed me to get to an RMSE of below 8.75.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**To further improve my model, I decided to use train_test_split to see how well my training set was predicting the test set. I found that my model was slightly underpredicting the test set. So, through trial and error, I multiplied my predicted values by different multipliers. It seemed that multiplying my predicted values by 1.27 was best, and I was able to achieve a final RMSE of around 8.41 on the public leaderboard.**"

I previously did not have any experience with models like CatBoost and Light Gradient Boosting, and I also had very limited experience with ensembling models. I am currently also taking Stat 303-3, so doing this project has been helpful in allowing me to apply other models that I have learned in that class such as MARS, XGBoost, and Random Forests. Although I did not end up using all the models that I explored, each model that I utilized allowed me to explore the dataset in more depth.**\n",

However, I did encounter several struggles throughout this project. Tuning some of the models and ensembling took quite long, and it was a little frustrating when the models I explored did not improve my RMSE.** \n",

    "**Overall, despite the challenges I faced during this project, I believe it has been a valuable learning experience. It has not only enhanced my coding and modeling skills but also taught me the importance of persistence and creativity when it comes to solving problems. I am now more confident in my ability to tackle real-world datasets and apply a variety of modeling techniques to achieve better results. I am grateful for the opportunity to explore various models and to experiment with ensembling techniques. This project has definitely broadened my understanding of feature selection, model ensembling, and the overall process of building effective predictive models. I look forward to applying these skills to future projects and further advancing my expertise in machine learning and data science.**"
